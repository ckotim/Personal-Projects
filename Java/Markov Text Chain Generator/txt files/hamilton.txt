AARON BURR:
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

JOHN LAURENS:
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by workin’ a lot harder
By bein’ a lot smarter
By bein’ a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

THOMAS JEFFERSON:
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

JAMES MADISON:
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, drippin’ down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

BURR:
Well the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man!”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world’s gonna know your name! What’s your name, man?"

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there’s a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait, just you wait

ELIZA HAMILTON:
When he was ten, his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden
Half-dead, sittin’ in their own sick
The scent thick

COMPANY:
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

GEORGE WASHINGTON and (COMPANY):
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin’ but ruined pride, somethin’ new inside
A voice saying "(Alex) you gotta fend for yourself"
He started retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the shelf

BURR and (COMPANY):
There would’ve been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He would’ve been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and other things he can’t afford
(Scammin’) for every book he can get his hands on
(Plannin’) for the future, see him now as he stands on (oooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

COMPANY and (HAMILTON):
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man

WOMEN:
In New York
MEN:
New York

HAMILTON:
Just you wait

COMPANY and (COMPANY):
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

BURR and (COMPANY):
The ship is in the harbor now, see if you can spot him
(Just you wait)
Another immigrant comin’ up from the bottom
(Just you wait)
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him

MULLIGAN/MADISON AND LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:
We fought with him

LAURENS/PHILLIP:
Me? I died for him

WASHINGTON:
Me? I trusted him

ANGELICA SCHUYLER, ELIZA, MARIA REYNOLDS:
Me? I loved him

BURR:
And me? I’m the damn fool that shot him

COMPANY:
There’s a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait

BURR:
What’s your name, man?

HAMILTON & COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!
COMPANY:
1776
New York City

HAMILTON:
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?

BURR:
That depends, who's asking?

HAMILTON:
Oh well sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton
I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

BURR:
I'm getting nervous

HAMILTON:
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort out of sorts with a buddy of yours
I may have punched him
It’s a blur, sir
He handles the financials—

BURR:
You punched the bursar?

HAMILTON:
Yes, I wanted to do what you did
Graduate in two, then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid
I’m not stupid
So how’d you do it?
How’d you graduate so fast?

BURR:
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

HAMILTON:
You're an orphan
Of course, I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for

BURR:
Can I buy you a drink?

HAMILTON:
That would be nice

BURR:
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

HAMILTON:
What?

BURR:
Smile more

HAMILTON:
Ha

BURR:
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

HAMILTON:
You can't be serious

BURR:
You want to get ahead?

HAMILTON:
Yes

BURR:
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

LAURENS:
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN:
Showtime!

BURR:
...like I said...

LAURENS:
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm working on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me
Cause I will pop chick-a-pop these cops 'til I'm free!

LAFAYETTE:
Ah oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the king, “Casse-toi!” Who's the best? C’est moi!

MULLIGAN:
Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it
Yes I heard your mother say “come again?”

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

MULLIGAN:
Lock up your daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets

LAFAYETTE:
Wow

LAURENS:
No more sex
Pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
To the revolution!

LAURENS:
Well if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton College

MULLIGAN:
Aaron Burr

LAURENS:
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge

BURR:
Good luck with that
You’re takin’ a stand
You spit, I’mma sit
We’ll see where we land

LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
Booooo/Ohhhhhh

LAURENS:
Burr, the revolution’s imminent
What do you stall for?

HAMILTON:
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Oooh

LAURENS:
Who are you?

MULLIGAN:
Who are you?

LAFAYETTE:
Who are you?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Who, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I'mma get scholarship to King's College
I probably shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains, but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word I drop knowledge

I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal, my power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen, but my mind is older
These New York City streets getting colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage. I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out my name
I am the—

HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN, LAURENS:
A-L, E-X, A-N, D
E-R—we are—meant to be

HAMILTON:
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shitting on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't never gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
ENTER ME!

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
(He says in parentheses)

HAMILTON:
Don't be shocked when your history book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually you'll see my ascendancy

HAMILTON and (LAURENS):
And I am not throwing away my shot (my shot)
I am not throwing away my shot (my shot)
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
[HAMILTON & LAURENS]
And I'm not throwing away my shot

HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

LAFAYETTE:
I dream of life without the monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to "onarchy"
"Onarchy?" How you say, how you s—Oh, anarchy!
When I fight I make the other side panicky
With my
HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
Shot!

MULLIGAN:
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
I'm gonna take a
HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
Shot!

LAURENS:
Eh, but we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I, do or die, wait till I sally in on a stallion
With the first black battalion
Have another
HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
Shot!

BURR:
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble, and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

HAMILTON:
Burr, check what we got
Mr. Lafayette hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

LAURENS:
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd!

COMPANY:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

LAURENS and (HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN):
Everybody sing
Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh (Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)
Hey
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)
Wooh!!
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)
Sing let 'em hear ya (Yeah)

LAURENS and (COMPANY):
Let's go! (Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)
I said, shout it to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)
Said to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)
Now come on
(Yeah)
Now come on, let's go

LAURENS:
Rise up
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's got to rise up
Tell your sister that she's got to rise up

LAURENS & ENSEMBLE and (COMPANY)
When are these colonies gonna rise up
(Whoa, woah)
When are these colonies gonna rise up (Woah)
When are these colonies gonna rise up (Woah)
When are these colonies gonna rise up (Woah)
Rise up

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it's gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it coming, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?

See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our Promised Land

And? If we win our independence?
'Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?

I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?

I'm past patiently waitin'! I'm passionately smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

HAMILTON & COMPANY:
And I am not throwin' away my shot
I am not throwin' away my shot
Hey, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS and (ENSEMBLE):
We gonna rise up; time to take a shot
(Not thrown’ away my shot)
We gonna rise up; time to take a shot
(Not throwin’ away my shot)

We gonna (rise up, rise up)

(Wo-oah) Time to take a shot (rise up)
Take a shot, a shot, a shot, (Oh-Oh, oh)
A-yo, it's time to take a shot (Woah, oh-oh oh)
Time to take a shot (Woah-oh)
And I am (And I am)
Not throwing away my

COMPANY:
Not throwing away my shot!

HAMILTON:

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:

There’s nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slumming it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common
Just to watch ‘em talk

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

Ooh, there’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone looking pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy’s got money
Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy heels?
You searchin’ for an urchin who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA:
Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ahh, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me

ANGELICA:
I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation

SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury, and I present 
"Free thoughts on the proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart

MULLIGAN: Oh my god. Tear this dude apart

SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This congress does not speak for me

BURR: Let him be

SEABURY:
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!

HAMILTON: Yo!

Heed not the rabble who

And what about Boston?
Look at the cost of all that we’ve lost
And you talk about Congress?

This Congress does not speak for me

You’re playing a dangerous game

Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me (laughter)
Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?

HAMILTON:

Drop the niceties

ENSEMBLE:
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
FULL COMPANY:
A message from the King!

You say the price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry in your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember despite our estrangement, I'm your man

You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well

Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove,
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da dayada

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da da

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone

And, no, don't change the subject
'Cause you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days

When you're gone, I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had
'Cause when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da dayada

Everybody!

Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I’m the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin’ letters to relatives
Embellishin’ my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I’m
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned                       [ENSEMBLE]
Outmanned                                 What?
Outnumbered
Outplanned                                 What?
.                                                Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I’m gonna need a 
right-hand man
.                                                Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
Incoming!      

[HAMILTON]
They’re battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let’s take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won’t abandon ship
Yo, let’s steal their cannons—

[MULLIGAN]                                            [COMPANY]
Shh-boom!                                              Boom!      

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and…

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we’re abandonin’ Kips Bay and…

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There’s another ship and…

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and…

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can’t afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they’re skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I’m in dire need of assistance…

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions 
on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well—

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you…

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don’t think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why’re you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I’m not—

[WASHINGTON]
It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin’ like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I’m being honest
I’m working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We’ll need some spies on the inside
Some King’s men who might let some things slide

[HAMILTON]               [COMPANY]    [ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY]
I’ll write to Congress     Boom!
and tell ‘em we need                        Whoa, whoa, whoa...
supplies, you rally
the guys, master the
element of surprise                           Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Chicka-boom!
I’ll rise above my
station, organize
your information, ‘til
we rise to the occasion                    Whoa, whoa, whoa...
of our new nation. Sir!

Rise up!

Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
What?

[WASHINGTON]
And his right hand man!

[FULL COMPANY]
Boom!

BURR:
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We’re
Reliable with the

ALL MEN:
Ladies!

BURR:
There are so many to deflower!

ALL MEN:
Ladies!

BURR:
Looks! Proximity to power

ALL MEN:

BURR:
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

HAMILTON:
That’s true

FULL COMPANY:
1780

BURR:
A winter’s ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you’re rich, son

HAMILTON:
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, “Yo, this
One’s mine.”                                              [ALL WOMEN]

My sister made her way across
the room to you                                         Oooh
And I got nervous, 
thinking “What’s she gonna do?”                  Oooh
She grabbed you by the arm,
I’m thinkin’ “I’m through”                            Oooh
Then you look back at me 
and suddenly I’m Helpless!                           Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes                               Look into your eyes

Oh!                                                         I’m
Yeah, I’m                                                 Helpless!

I’m so into you                                          Look into your eyes
I am so into you                                        And the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!


I know I’m down for the count                    Down for the count
And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.                             And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I’ll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you would share him

[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later                                        [ALL WOMEN]
In the living room stressin’                           Stressin’
My father’s stone-faced
While you’re asking for his blessin’                 Blessin’
I’m dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry
‘cause there’s nothing 
that your mind can’t do                              Oooh
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
“we’re through”                                        Oooh

“Be true”                                                   Oooh
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so…

ANGELICA:
I remember that night, I just might regret that night for the rest of my days.
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you can’t quite place,
but Alexander, I’ll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same, Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame, 
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name, set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame,
FULL COMPANY:
This is not a game…
HAMILTON:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.
ANGELICA:
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself.
HAMILTON:
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied.
ANGELICA:
Is that right?
HAMILTON:
I have never been satisfied.
ANGELICA:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.
HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton.
ANGELICA:
Where’s your fam’ly from?
HAMILTON:
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but just you wait, just you wait…
ANGELICA:
So so so— so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level! 
What the hell is the catch? It’s the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light, 
it’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? The conversation lasted two minutes, 
maybe three minutes, ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s a dream and it’s a bit of a dance,
a bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance. 
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance? 
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants.
Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it! 
I wanna take him far away from this place, then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is...
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And I know she is...
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And her eyes are just…
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And I realize
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?
ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life.
HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.
COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)
Number one!
ANGELICA
I’m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. 
My father has no sons so I’m the one who has to social climb for one, 
so I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious, 
Alexander is penniless, Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less.
ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
HAMILTON
Schuyler?
ANGELICA
My sister.
COMPANY
Number two!
ANGELICA
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status, I’d have to be naïve to set that aside, 
maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza, now that’s his bride. 
Nice going, Angelica, he was right, You will never be satisfied.
ELIZA
Thank you for all your service.
HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.
ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it.
COMPANY
Number three!
ANGELICA
I know my sister like I know my own mind, you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind. 
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned, he’d be mine. She would say, “I’m fine”
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
She’d be lying.
ANGELICA
But when I fantasize at night it’s Alexander’s eyes, 
as I romanticize what might have been if I hadn’t sized him up so quickly. 
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife; at least I keep his eyes in my life…
ANGELICA AND ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!
ANGELICA:
To the bride!
ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)
To the bride! To the bride! To the bride!
ANGELICA
From your sister,

WOMEN:

You provide! You provide! You provide!
May you always

his bride. And I know Be satisfied. Be satisfied. Be satisfied. Be satisfied. Be satisfied. Be satisfied.

He will never be satisfied. I will never be satisfied.

But I've seen wonders great and small.

There's hope for our ass, after all!

Hey!
Something you will never see again!

MULLIGAN
No matter what she tells you.

LAFAYETTE
Let's have another round tonight!

LAURENS
Raise a glass to the four of us!

LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Ho!

MULLIGAN
To the newly not poor of us!

LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Woo!

LAFAYETTE
We'll tell the story of tonight.

LAURENS
Let's have another round-

HAMILTON
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr.

BURR
Sir!

HAMILTON
I didn't think you would make it.

BURR
To be sure.

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
Burr!

BURR
I came to say congratulations.

MULLIGAN
Spit a verse, Burr!

BURR
I see the whole gang is here.

LAFAYETTE
You are the worst, Burr!

HAMILTON
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel.
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal.

BURR
No, you don't.

HAMILTON
Yes, I do.

BURR
Now, be sensible.
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable.

LAURENS
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr.

HAMILTON
Is that so?

LAURENS
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

BURR
I should go.

HAMILTON
No, these guys should go.

LAFAYETTE
What?

LAURENS
No!

HAMILTON
Leave us alone.

MULLIGAN
Man...

HAMILTON
It's alright, Burr.
I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr.

BURR
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir.

HAMILTON
What do you mean?

BURR
She's married.

HAMILTON
I see.

BURR
She's married to a British officer.

HAMILTON
Oh shit...

BURR
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more.
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON
I will never understand you.
If you love this woman, go get here!
What are you waiting for?

BURR
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

BURR
Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away.
He's on the British side of Georgia.
He's tryin' to keep the colonies in line.
He can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she's mine.

Love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.

We laugh and we cry
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
when so many have tried
then I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

What's it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.
He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.
He plays and he raises the stakes.
And if there's a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive,
the Goddamnit-

I'm willing to wait for it.

I'm willing to wait for it...
Life doesn't discriminate

ELIZA:
Stay alive…

ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN:
Stay alive…

HAMILTON:
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.”
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

WASHINGTON:
The cavalry’s not coming

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

HAMILTON:
That’s right

WASHINGTON:
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

HAMILTON:
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

WASHINGTON:
Outrun

HAMILTON:
Outrun

WASHINGTON:
Outlast

HAMILTON:
Outlast

WASHINGTON:
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

HAMILTON:
Chick-a-plao!

WASHINGTON:
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass!

MULLIGAN:
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

LAFAYETTE:
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

LAURENS:
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day’s a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

HAMILTON:
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev’ry day
“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
And ev’ry day

WASHINGTON:
No

HAMILTON:
He dismisses me out of hand

HAMILTON:                                                           ELIZA/ANGELICA:
Instead of me                                                        Stay alive...
He promotes                                                         LEE:
Charles Lee                                                           Charles Lee.
Makes him second-in-command:      

LEE:
I’m a General. Whee!!!!

HAMILTON:
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone with

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

WASHINGTON:
Ev’ryone attack!

LEE:
Retreat!

WASHINGTON:
Attack!

LEE:
Retreat!

WASHINGTON:
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

LEE:
But there’s so many of them!

WASHINGTON:
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Ready, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Have Lafayette take the lead!

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir!

LAURENS:
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

LAFAYETTE:
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

HAMILTON:
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen:

LEE:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon

COMPANY:
Oo!!

WASHINGTON:
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong

HAMILTON:
But, sir!

WASHINGTON:
We have a war to fight, let’s move along

LAURENS:
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

HAMILTON:
I can’t disobey direct orders

LAURENS:
Then I’ll do it
Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got

HAMILTON:
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

MEN:
One, two, three, four

FULL COMPANY:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE:
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments

FULL COMPANY:
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

LAURENS:
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

COMPANY:
Number two!

LAURENS:
If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second

HAMILTON:
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned

COMPANY:
Number three!

LEE:
Have your seconds meet face to face

BURR:
Negotiate a peace…

HAMILTON:
Or negotiate a time and place

BURR:
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

COMPANY:
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

LAURENS:
If they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

HAMILTON:
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

BURR:
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

COMPANY:
Five!

LEE:
Duel before the sun is in the sky

COMPANY:
Pick a place to die where it’s high and dry
Number six!

HAMILTON:
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

COMPANY:
Seven!

LEE:
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

COMPANY:
Number eight!

LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR:
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…

BURR:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Aaron Burr, sir

BURR:
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

HAMILTON:
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

BURR:
With his life? We both know that’s absurd, sir

HAMILTON:
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

BURR:
Okay, so we’re doin’ this

COMPANY:
Number nine!

HAMILTON:
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

MEN:
One two three four

FULL COMPANY:
Five six seven eight nine

HAMILTON/BURR:
Number

COMPANY:
Ten paces!

HAMILTON/BURR:
Fire!

HAMILTON:
Lee, do you yield?

BURR:
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

LAURENS:
I’m satisfied

BURR:
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

HAMILTON:
Go! We won

COMPANY:
Here comes the General!

BURR:
This should be fun

WASHINGTON:
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

BURR:
Yes, sir

WASHINGTON:
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don’t speak for me
Thank you for your service

BURR:
Let’s ride!

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Meet me inside

COMPANY:
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

WASHINGTON:
Son—

HAMILTON:
Don’t call me son

WASHINGTON:
This war is hard enough
Without infighting

HAMILTON:
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

WASHINGTON:
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

HAMILTON:
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would’ve shut him up

WASHINGTON:
Son

HAMILTON:
I’m notcha son

WASHINGTON:
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING):
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

WASHINGTON:
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it

HAMILTON:
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have your titles
I don’t have your land
But, if you

WASHINGTON:
No

HAMILTON:
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, 
I could fly above my station after the war

WASHINGTON:
Or you could die and we need you alive

HAMILTON:
I’m more than willing to die

WASHINGTON:
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive

HAMILTON:
Call me son one more time

WASHINGTON:
Go home, Alexander
That’s an order from your commander

HAMILTON:
Sir

WASHINGTON:
Go home

ELIZA:
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

HAMILTON:
How long have you known?

ELIZA:
A month or so

HAMILTON:
Eliza, you should have told me

ELIZA:
I wrote to the General a month ago

HAMILTON:
No

ELIZA:
I begged him to send you home

HAMILTON:
You should have told me

ELIZA:
I’m not sorry

ELIZA:
I knew you’d fight                                       HAMILTON:
Until the war was won                                 The war’s not Done.

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.

HAMILTON:
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife
Unable to provide for your life?

ELIZA:
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

BURR:
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I’m takin this horse by the reins makin’
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I’m

Enragin’ em! I’m—

LAFAYETTE:

COMPANY:

LAFAYETTE:
I come back with more

LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE:
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

LAFAYETTE:
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:

WASHINGTON:
I know

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, you’re gonna have to use him eventually
What’s he gonna do on the bench? I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
You wanna fight for your land back?

COMPANY:
Hamilton!

WASHINGTON:
I need my right hand man back!

WOMEN:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:                                                        MEN:
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back                        Get your right hand man back!
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back      Your right hand man back!

I mean you gotta put                                           Hamilton!
some thought into the letter                                 Ha—
but the sooner the better                                     Ha—
To get your right hand man back!

WOMEN, MEN:
Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha— ha—!

WASHINGTON:
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They’ll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander…

WASHINGTON:
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake

We're finally on the field. We’ve had quite a run

LAFAYETTE:
Immigrants:

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
We get the job done

HAMILTON:
So what happens if we win?

LAFAYETTE:
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I’m given the chance

HAMILTON:
We’ll be with you when you do

LAFAYETTE:
Go lead your men

HAMILTON:
See you on the other side

LAFAYETTE:
‘Til we meet again, let’s go!

ENSEMBLE:
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Hey yo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!

HAMILTON:
‘Til the world turns upside down…

ENSEMBLE:
‘Til the world turns upside down!

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza’s expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE:
What?

HAMILTON:
The bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE:
What?

HAMILTON:
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

ENSEMBLE:
Rochambeau!

HAMILTON:
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry

HAMILTON/LAURENS:
We’ll never be free until we end slavery!

HAMILTON:
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting—

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
In Chesapeake Bay!

HAMILTON:
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That’s right

HAMILTON/COMPANY:
Hercules Mulligan!

MULLIGAN:
A tailor spyin’ on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

COMPANY:
Up

MULLIGAN:
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I’m runnin’ with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin’ it!
See, that’s what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

COMPANY:
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

HAMILTON:
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

LAFAYETTE:
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

MULLIGAN:
And just like that, it’s over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

LAURENS:
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

WASHINGTON:
Not. Yet

HAMILTON:
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they’re singing…

ALL MEN:
The world turned upside down

FULL COMPANY:
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

LAFAYETTE:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

They say,
The price of my war is not a price that they are willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French
Now I am fighting with France and with Spain
I am so blue
I thought that we made an arrangement when you went away
You were mine to subdue
When even despite our estrangement
I got a small query for yooouu
What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?
You're on your own
Awesome...wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?
Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call
All alone
Cross the sea
When your people say they hate you
Don't come crawling back to me
Da da da da da
Da da da da daye da
Da da da da daye da
You're on your own...

[Burr]
Dear Theodosia what to say to you
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name
When you came into the world you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday x2
Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday x2

[Hamilton]
Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh, Phillip you outshine the morning sun, my son
When you smile, I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

My father wasn't around

[Burr]
My father wasn't around

[Hamilton]
I swear that

[Both]
I'll be around for you

[Hamilton]
I'll do whatever it takes

[Burr]
I'll make a million mistakes

[Both]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you

You'll come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday x2
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series 
of essays defending the new United States Constitution, 
entitled The Federalist Papers. 
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays,

they wrote eighty-five essays, 
in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. 
James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system

I respond
“What’s goin’ on?”      

MADISON:
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation’s very soul
Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

MADISON:
Hamilton’s new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control
I’ve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

JEFFERSON:
Uh...France.

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!     

MADISON:
We have to win

JEFFERSON:
What’d I miss?

ENSEMBLE:
Wha? Wha? What’d I miss?

JEFFERSON:
What’d I miss?

ENSEMBLE:
I’ve come home to this?

JEFFERSON:
Headfirst into a political abyss!

ENSEMBLE:
Headfirst, into the abyss!

JEFFERSON:
I have my first cabinet meeting today

ENSEMBLE:
Chik-a-pow!

JEFFERSON:
I guess I better think of something to say
I’m already on my way
Let’s get to the bottom of this…      

ENSEMBLE:
What did I miss? Ahhh ah!

WASHINGTON:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

HAMILTON:
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

COMPANY:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you’ve been off in Paris for so long!

JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?

WASHINGTON:
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, 
but you’re here with us in New York City. 
Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt
and establish a national bank. 
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

JEFFERSON:
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em

JEFFERSON & MADISON:
Oww

JEFFERSON:
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

HAMILTON:
Not true!

JEFFERSON:
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York’s in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky

WASHINGTON:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response

HAMILTON:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who’s really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin’ there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you
Where my shoe fits

WASHINGTON:
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk! Hamilton, 
take a walk! We’ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
A word

MADISON:
You don’t have the votes

JEFFERSON/MADISON:
You don’t have the votes

JEFFERSON:
Aha-ha-ha ha!

JEFFERSON/MADISON:
You’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes

JEFFERSON:
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

MADISON:
Why he even brings the thunder…

WASHINGTON:
You wanna pull yourself together?

HAMILTON:
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

WASHINGTON:
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your mouth

HAMILTON:
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

WASHINGTON:
You need the votes

HAMILTON:
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

WASHINGTON:
No, you need to convince more folks

HAMILTON:
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a nonstarter

WASHINGTON:
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder

HAMILTON:
They’re being intransigent

WASHINGTON:
You have to find a compromise

HAMILTON:
But they don’t have a plan, they just hate mine!

WASHINGTON:
Convince them otherwise

HAMILTON:
What happens if I don’t get congressional approval?

WASHINGTON:
I imagine they’ll call for your removal

HAMILTON:
Sir—

WASHINGTON:
Figure it out, Alexander. That’s an order from your commander

ELIZA:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf   

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf

ELIZA AND PHILIP:
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

HAMILTON:
My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
I am on my way

ELIZA:
There’s a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

HAMILTON:
I’ll be there in just a minute, save my plate

ELIZA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Okay, okay

ELIZA:
Your son is nine years old today
Has something he’d like to say
He’s been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

PHILIP:
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can’t write mine

HAMILTON:
What!

PHILIP:
I practice French
And play piano with my mother

HAMILTON:
Uh-huh!

PHILIP:
I have a sister, but I want a little brother

HAMILTON:
Okay!

PHILIP:
My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!      

HAMILTON:
Bravo!

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

ELIZA:
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

HAMILTON:
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate

ELIZA:
We can all go stay with my father
There’s a lake I know…

HAMILTON:
I know

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

HAMILTON:
I’d love to go

ELIZA:
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

HAMILTON:
I will try to get away

ANGELICA:
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days
It says:

HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
“My dearest Angelica”

ANGELICA:
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
“My dearest, Angelica.”

ANGELICA:
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
You won’t be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

ELIZA:
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica’s arriving today! Angelica!

ANGELICA:
Eliza!

HAMILTON:
The Schuyler sisters!

ANGELICA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Hi

ANGELICA:
It’s good to see your face

ELIZA:
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

HAMILTON:
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn’t have a real job anyway

ANGELICA:
…you’re not joining us? Wait

HAMILTON:
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate

ANGELICA:
Alexander, I came all this way

ELIZA:
She came all this way

ANGELICA:
All this way

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

HAMILTON:
I lose my job if I don’t get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father

ELIZA:
There’s a lake I know

ANGELICA:
I know I’ll miss your face

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

ELIZA:
You and I can go

ANGELICA:
Eliza’s right

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

ELIZA:
Let’s go upstate
Where we can stay

ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time

ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA:
We can go

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.

HAMILTON:
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can’t stop until I get this plan through Congress
BURR:
There’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it

HAMILTON:
I hadn’t slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

MARIA:
I know you are a man of honor
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…

HAMILTON:
She said:

MARIA:
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone
I don’t have the means to go on

HAMILTON:
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

MARIA:
You’re too kind, sir

HAMILTON:
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

MARIA:
This one’s mine, sir

HAMILTON:
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

MARIA:
Stay?

HAMILTON:
Hey…

MARIA:
Hey…

HAMILTON:
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”

MARIA:
Whoa...

HAMILTON:
Nooo, show me how to

HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE:
Say no to this

HAMILTON:
I don’t know how to

HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE:
Say no to this

HAMILTON:
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go

ENSEMBLE:
Go! Go! Go!

HAMILTON:
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…

ENSEMBLE:
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

HAMILTON:
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

JAMES:
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

HAMILTON:
Fuuuu

JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife

HAMILTON:
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:

MARIA:
No, sir!

HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

MARIA:
Please don’t go, sir!

HAMILTON:
So was your whole story a setup?

MARIA:
I don’t know about any letter!

HAMILTON:
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!

MARIA:
I didn’t know any better

HAMILTON:
I am ruined...

MARIA:
Please don’t leave me with him helpless

HAMILTON:
I am helpless—how could I do this?

MARIA:
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

HAMILTON:
I don’t want you

MARIA:
Whatever you want

HAMILTON:
I don’t want you

MARIA:                HAMILTON:
If you pay            I don’t…
You can stay
.                     Lord, show me how to             ENSEMBLE:
.                     Say no to this                         Say no to this!
Tonight               I don’t know how to
.                     Say no to this                         Say no to this!
.                     Cuz the situation’s helpless
Helpless
.                     And her body’s screaming,
.                     “Hell, yes”
Whoa!
.                     No, show me how to
.                     Say no to this                        Say no to this!
How can you           How can I
Say no to this?       Say no to this?                 Say no to this!
.                     There is nowhere I can go
.                                                                Go! Go! Go!
.                     When her body’s on mine
.                     I do not say…                   
HAMILTON:
Yes

MARIA:                ENSEMBLE:
Yes!                  Say no to this! No!

HAMILTON:
Yes

MARIA:
Yes!                  Say no to this! No!

HAMILTON:
Yes

MARIA:
Yes!                  Say no to this! No!

HAMILTON:
Yes

MARIA:
Yes!                  Say no to this!

HAMILTON:
Say no to this…

MARIA:
Don’t say no to this

HAMILTON:
I don’t say no to this
There is nowhere I can go.

ENSEMBLE:
Go go go...

JAMES:
So?

HAMILTON:
Nobody needs to know
BURR:
Ah, Mister Secretary

HAMILTON:
Mister Burr, sir

BURR:
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

HAMILTON:
No

BURR:
You know Clermont Street?

HAMILTON:
Yeah

BURR:
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

HAMILTON:
Sure

BURR:
And all he had to do was die

HAMILTON:
That’s a lot less work

BURR:
We oughta give it a try

HAMILTON:
Ha

BURR:
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?

HAMILTON:
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you

BURR:
Really?

HAMILTON:
“Talk less. Smile more.”

BURR:
Ha

HAMILTON:
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

BURR:
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

HAMILTON:
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

MADISON:
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go

BURR:
But—

HAMILTON:
Decisions are happening over dinner

BURR:
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Diametric’ly opposed, foes

BURR:
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Previously closed

ENSEMBLE:
Bros

BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:

BURR:
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Alexander said

HAMILTON:
I’ve nowhere else to turn!

JEFFERSON:
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
I approached Madison and said
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

BURR:
But!
No one else was in

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR:
No one else was in

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR:
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

BURR AND COMPANY:
Meanwhile

BURR:
Madison is grappling with the fact 
that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

COMPANY:
Meanwhile

BURR:
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

Company screams in chaos

BURR:
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

MADISON:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another 
and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words

JEFFERSON:
Oh-ho!

MADISON:
A quid pro quo

JEFFERSON:
I suppose

MADISON:
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?

JEFFERSON:
Actually, I would

MADISON:
Well, I propose the Potomac

JEFFERSON:
And you’ll provide him his votes?

MADISON:
Well, we’ll see how it goes

JEFFERSON:
Let’s go

BURR:
No!

COMPANY:
one else was in
The room where it happened

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR:
My God!

BURR AND COMPANY:
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

BURR:
And no one else was in the room where it happened

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
What did they say to you to get you 
to sell New York City down the river?

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

HAMILTON:
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot

BURR:
You got more than you gave

HAMILTON:
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

HAMILTON AND COMPANY:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

HAMILTON:
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me

HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/MADISON/WASHINGTON:
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?

If you stand for nothing
Burr, then what do you fall for?

BURR:
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

BURR:                                         COMPANY:

In that big ol’ room                    The room where it happens

COMPANY:
The art of the compromise—

BURR:
Hold your nose and close your eyes

COMPANY:
We want our leaders to save the day—

BURR:
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away

COMPANY:
We dream of a brand new start—

BURR:
But we dream in the dark for the most part

BURR AND COMPANY:
Dark as a tomb where it happens

PHILLIP:
Look!
Grandpa’s in the paper!
“War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr”
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

ELIZA:
Sometimes that’s how it goes

PHILLIP:
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute

ELIZA:
I’m sure he already knows

PHILLIP:
Further down

PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Further down

PHILLIP:
Let’s meet the newest senator from New York

ELIZA:
New York

PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Our senator

HAMILTON:
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

BURR:
Since being one put me on the up and up again

HAMILTON:
No one knows who you are or what you do

BURR:
They don’t need to know me
They don’t like you

HAMILTON:
Excuse me?

BURR:
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—

HAMILTON:
Wait

BURR:
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it

HAMILTON:
I’ve always considered you a friend

BURR:
I don’t see why that has to end

HAMILTON:
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

BURR:
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall

[WASHINGTON]
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England, 
and do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it? 
Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval. 
The only person you have to convince is me. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.

[JEFFERSON]
When we were on death’s door
When we were needy
We made a promise
We signed a treaty
We need money and guns and half a chance
Uh, who provided those funds?

[MADISON]
France.

[JEFFERSON]
In return, they didn’t ask for land,
Only a promise that we’d lend a hand
And stand with them
If they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy
But now is the time to stand!
Stand with our brothers
As they fight against tyranny.
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate;
I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State!
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station,
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation.
Hey, and if you don’t know, now you know, Mr. President.

[WASHINGTON]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response?

[HAMILTON]
You must be out of your goddamn mind
If you think
The President is going to bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess,
A game of chess,
Where France is Queen and King-less.
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket,
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’s head?
“Uh, do whatever you want I’m super dead!”

[WASHINGTON]
Enough enough, Hamilton is right.

[JEFFERSON]
Mr. President!

[WASHINGTON]
We’re too fragile to start another fight.

[JEFFERSON]
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

[WASHINGTON]
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em.

[JEFFERSON]
The people are leading!

[WASHINGTON]
The people are rioting! There’s a difference!
Frankly it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality!
Hamilton?

[HAMILTON]
Sir

[WASHINGTON]
Draft the statement of neutrality.
[JEFFERSON]
Did you forget Lafayette?

[HAMILTON]
What?

[JEFFERSON]
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power.
Yet in their hour of need, you forget.

[HAMILTON]
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine.
And before he was your friend, he was mine.
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world,
We never stop. Where do we draw the line?

[JEFFERSON]
So quick witted.

[HAMILTON]
Alas, I admit it.

[JEFFERSON]
I bet you were quite a lawyer.

[HAMILTON]
My defendants got acquitted

[JEFFERSON]
Yeah, well someone ought to remind you

[HAMILTON]
What?

[JEFFERSON]
You’re nothing without Washington behind you.

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[JEFFERSON]
Daddy’s calling!
[Intro: Aaron Burr]
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side (x2)

[Verse 1: Thomas Jefferson]
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.
Thanks to Hamilton, our cabinet’s fractured into factions.
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions.
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is asking for someone to bring him to task
Somebody give me some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

[Hook: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison (ALL)]
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side (x2)
Look back at the Bill of Rights (which I wrote!)
The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

[Verse 2: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison (ALL)]
So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size
Look in his eyes, see how he lies, follow the scent of his enterprise
Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive
If we don’t stop it, we aid and abet it.
I have to resign!
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
Well, somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse, 
You can’t put it out from inside the house!
I’m in the cabinet, I am complicit in watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen to disciplined dissidents, 
This is the difference, this kid is OUT!

[Bridge: Chorus]
OH! This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose!
OH! This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes!
OH! Let’s show these Federalists what they’re up against!
OH! Southern motherfucking (uh-huh) Democratic-Republicans!
OH! Let’s follow the money and see where it goes!
OH! Because every second, the treasury grows!
OH! If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamilton’s misdeeds!

[Outro: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison (ALL)]
It must be nice, it must be nice…
Follow the money and see where it goes!
It must be nice, it must be nice…
The emperor has no clothes
We won’t be invisible
We won’t be denied!
Still…
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
HAMILTON:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

WASHINGTON:
I know you’re busy

HAMILTON:
What do you need, sir? Sir?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna give you a word of warning

HAMILTON:
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

WASHINGTON:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

HAMILTON:
You’re kidding

WASHINGTON:
I need a favor

HAMILTON:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

WASHINGTON:
Shh. Talk less

HAMILTON:
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him

WASHINGTON:
I need you to draft an address

HAMILTON:
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind

WASHINGTON:
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President

HAMILTON:
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

WASHINGTON:
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President

HAMILTON:
I’m sorry, what?

WASHINGTON:
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

HAMILTON:
No, sir, why?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna talk about neutrality

HAMILTON:
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time

WASHINGTON:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

HAMILTON:
But—

WASHINGTON:
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

HAMILTON:
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

WASHINGTON:
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I

HAMILTON:
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

WASHINGTON:
No, they will see we’re strong

HAMILTON:
Your position is so unique

WASHINGTON:
So I’ll use it to move them along

HAMILTON:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

WASHINGTON:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

HAMILTON:
One last time

HAMILTON:
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, 
I am unconscious of intentional error, 
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think 
it probable that I may have committed many errors. 
I shall also carry with me

HAMILTON & WASHINGTON:
The hope

HAMILTON:
That my country will

HAMILTON & WASHINGTON:
View them with indulgence;

HAMILTON:
And that

HAMILTON & WASHINGTON:
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal

HAMILTON:
The faults of incompetent abilities will be

HAMILTON & WASHINGTON:
Consigned oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which 
I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, 
in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, 
and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.

WASHINGTON:
One last time

ALL WOMEN:
George Washington’s going home!

HAMILTON:
Teach ‘em how to say goodbye

COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

WASHINGTON:
You and I

COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

WASHINGTON:                           COMPANY:

Say goodbye!                             Teach ‘em how to say goodbye!
Teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!                             Teach ‘em how!
To say goodbye!
.                                               Say goodbye!
Say goodbye!
.                                               Say goodbye!
One last time!
.                                               One last time!
They say,
George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away

Is that true? I wasn't aware that was something a person could do

I'm perplexed. Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge?
If so who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large

[whispers]

[Spoken]
John Adams?

I know him
That can't be
That's that little guy who spoke to me all those years ago
What was it '85?
That poor man they're going to eat him alive

Ocean\'s rise, empires fall
Next to Washington they all look small

All alone watch them run
They will tear each other in to pieces Jesus Christ this will be fun

Da da da da da
Da da da da daye da
Da da da da daye da
[laughs]

[Spoken]
President John Adams,
Good luck!
BURR:
How does Hamilton,
the short-tempered, protean creator
of the coast guard,
founder of the New York Post
ardently abuse his cabinet post
destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adam’s Admistration.
Jefferson’s the runner-up
which makes him the vice-president,

MADISON:
Washington can’t help you now,
no more Mr. nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton,
Privatley calls him creole bastard in his toss
(JEFFERSON: Say what?)
Hamilton publishes his response.

HAMILTON:
Sit down John,
you fat mother-fucker.

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton’s out of control,

MADISON:
This is great:
He’s out of power,
he holds no office
and he just destroyed president John Adams
the only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself,
as long as he can hold a pen,
he’s a threat.
Let’s let him know what we know.
HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

JEFFERSON:
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts…

MADISON:
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…

BURR:
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
Seventeen ninety-one

HAMILTON:
Is that what you have? Are you done?

MADISON:
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

JEFFERSON:
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation

MADISON:
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

JEFFERSON:
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation

BURR:
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

JEFFERSON/MADISON:
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

BURR:
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

HAMILTON:
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Confess

HAMILTON:
You got nothing. I don’t have to tell you anything at all
Unless

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Unless

HAMILTON:
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

BURR:
No one else was in the room where it happened

HAMILTON:
Is that a yes?

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Um, yes

BURR:
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to”

JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat—

HAMILTON:
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That’s when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered
History. Check it again against your list n’ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

JEFFERSON:
My God

MADISON:
Gentlemen, let’s go

HAMILTON:
So?

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
The people won't know what we know

HAMILTON:
Burr!
How do I know you won’t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

BURR:
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both
Know what we know
HAMILTON:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn’t seem to die

BURR:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

HAMILTON:
Write ev’rything down, far as I can see…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

WASHINTON, ELIZA, ANGELICA & MARIA:
History has its eyes on you.

HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty.

HAMILTON:
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy…

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Have you read this?
You ever see somebody ruin their own life?

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON/ELIZA):
His poor wife
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said: "Be careful with that one, love
he will do what it takes to survive."

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals

I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought this girl
Into our bed
In clearing your name
You have ruined our lives

Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?
She said: "You have married an Icarus.
He has flown too close to the sun."

You and your words obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you-
You, you, you

I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder
How Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I'm watching it burn
Watching it burn

The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories
Burning the letters
that might have redeemed you

You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You'll sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
of when you were mine

I hope that you burn

Meet the latest graduate of King’s College!
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops!
I’m only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday
I would—

ENSEMBLE:
Blow us all away

PHILIP:
Ladies, I’m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd
I can’t have that, I’m making my father proud

MARTHA:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin’ to see a play

PHILIP:
Well, I’ll go visit his box

DOLLY:
God, you’re a fox

And y’all look pretty good in ya’ frocks
How ‘bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

Talked about my father though!

I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true
You father’s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooooooooh!

It’s like that?

Yeah, I don’t fool around
I’m not your little schoolboy friends

See you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

GEORGE:
I know where to find you, piss off
I’m watchin’ this show now

PHILIP:
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—

HAMILTON:
Slow down

PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel
They don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school

HAMILTON:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

PHILIP:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

HAMILTON:
Where is this happening?

PHILIP:
Across the river, in Jersey

HAMILTON/PHILIP:
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

HAMILTON
Alright. So this is what you’re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

PHILIP:
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m a goner

HAMILTON:
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor
To take someone’s life, that is something you can’t shake
Philip, your mother can’t take another heartbreak

PHILIP:
Father—

HAMILTON:
Promise me. You don’t want this
Young man’s blood on your conscience

PHILIP:
Okay, I promise

Come back home when you’re done
Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

I’d rather skip the pleasantries
Let’s go
Grab your pistol

Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

Already infected when he arrived—

PHILIP:
I would always change the line

ELIZA:
I know, I know

ELIZA:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Good
Un deux trois quatre              PHILIP:
Cinq six sept                         Un deux trois…
Huit neuf
Sept huit neuf—
Sept huit…

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words don’t reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when you’re in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE:
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

HAMILTON:
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it’s quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself, have pity

HAMILTON:
Philip, you would like it uptown
It’s quiet uptown

ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
He is working through the unimaginable

ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
His hair has gone grey. He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

HAMILTON:
You knock me out, I fall apart

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
Can you imagine?

HAMILTON:
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out. That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He’d be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges we’re facing
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
And you need time
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity

HAMILTON:
Eliza, do you like it uptown? It’s quiet uptown

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

HAMILTON:
Look around, look around, Eliza

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
They are trying to do the unimaginable

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words don’t reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza’s side
She takes his hand

ELIZA:
It’s quiet uptown

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity
They are going through the unimaginable
[Intro: Thomas Jefferson, (Ensemble)]
The Election of 1800!
Can we get back to politics?
Please?
Yo…

[Verse 1: Thomas Jefferson]
Every action has its equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed; I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I’m facing Aaron Burr with his own faction

[James Madison]
He’s very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances

[Jefferson]
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

[Madison]
Ask him a question, it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

[Jefferson]
And they say I’m a Francophile, at least they know I know where France is

[Madison]
Thomas, that’s the problem; see, they see Burr as a less extreme you
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you

[Jefferson]
Who did you have in mind?

[Madison]
Don’t laugh

[Jefferson]
Who is it?

[Madison]
You used to work on the same staff.

[Jefferson]
Whaaaat?

[Hook 1: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison]

[Madison]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Jefferson and Madison]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Break: Aaron Burr and (Ensemble)]
Talk less! (Burr!)
Smile more! (Burr!)
Don\'t let them know what you\'re against or what you\'re for! (Burr!)
Shake hands with him! (Burr!)
Charm her! (Burr!)
It’s 1800; ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!

[Verse 2: Various Ensemble]
I don’t like Adams! Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist.
And Jefferson? In love with France! Yeah, he’s so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr! I can’t believe we’re here with him!
He seems approachable? Like you could grab a beer with him

[Bridge 1: (Alexander Hamilton) & Ensemble]
Dear Mr. Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how you’ll be voting
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
We know, it’s lose/lose
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to choose…
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
But if you had to choose!

[Verse 3: Alexander Hamilton & Aaron Burr]

[Hamilton]
Well, if isn’t Aaron Burr, sir.

[Burr]
Alexander!

[Hamilton]
You’ve created quite a stir, sir.

[Burr]
I’m going door to door!


[Hamilton]
You’re openly campaigning?

[Burr]
Sure!

[Hamilton]
That’s new.

[Burr]
Honestly, it’s kind of draining


[Hamilton]
Burr?

[Burr]
Sir?

[Hamilton]
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

[Burr]
No, I’m chasing what I want, and you know what?

[Hamilton]
What?

[Burr]
I learned that from you

[Bridge 2: James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and (Ensemble)]

(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)

[Madison]
…It’s a tie

(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)

[Jefferson]
It’s up to the delegates


(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)

[Jefferson and Madison]
It’s up to Hamilton!

(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)
(Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?)
(Choose, choose, choose!)

[Verse 4: Alexander Hamilton and (Ensemble)]
Yo
(Oh!) The people are asking to hear my voice
(Oh!) But the country is facing a difficult choice
(Oh!) And you were to ask me who I’d promote…
(Oh!) …Jefferson has my vote
(Oh!) I have never agreed with Jefferson once…
(Oh!) We have fought on like 75 different fronts
(Oh!) But when all said and all is done…
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

[Hook 2: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, James Madison and (Ensemble)]
(Ooooh!)

[Jefferson and Madison]
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!

[Madison]
Hamilton’s on your side

(Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!)

[Madison]
And… you won in a landslide

[Burr]
Congrats on a race well won
I did give you a fight.

[Jefferson]
Uh-huh…

[Burr]
I look forward to our partnership.

[Jefferson]
Our partnership?

[Burr]
As your vice president!

[Jefferson]
[laughs] Yeah, right!

[Outro: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison]

[Jefferson]
You hear this guy?
Man openly campaigns against me, talking ‘bout “I look forward to our partnership!”

[Madison]
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president

[Jefferson]
OOOH! Y’know what, we can change that! Y’know why?

[Madison]
Why?

[Jefferson]
‘Cause I’m the president!
Burr…
When you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.

BURR:
How does Hamilton
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he’s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

BURR:
You’ve kept me from

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happens

BURR:
For the last time

Dear Alexander:

I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me “amoral,”
A “dangerous disgrace,”
If you’ve got something to say
Name a time and place
Face to face

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Burr

HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President:

I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

BURR:
Sweet Jesus

HAMILTON:
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic
I don’t wanna fight
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Ham

BURR:
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

HAMILTON:
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself
It’s what you do
I can’t apologize because it’s true

BURR:
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

HAMILTON:
You’re on

BURR AND HAMILTON:
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

HAMILTON:
A dot Ham

BURR:
A dot Burr
[ELIZA]
Alexander, come back to sleep

[HAMILTON]
I have an early meeting out of town

[ELIZA]
It's still dark outside

[HAMILTON]
I know, I just need to write something down

[ELIZA]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

[HAMILTON]
Shh

[ELIZA]
Come back to bed, that would be enough

[HAMILTON]
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

[ELIZA]
Come back to sleep

[HAMILTON]
This meeting's at dawn

[ELIZA]
Well I'm going back to sleep

[HAMILTON]
Hey, best of wives and best of women
WASHINGTON:
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Jefferson:

JEFFERSON:
I’ll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldn’t undo it if I tried
And I tried

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Madison:

MADISON:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA:
Every other founding father story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

BURR:
But when you’re gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

BURR AND MEN:
Who tells your story?                                ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
.                                                            Who tells your story?
Who tells your story?                                Your story?

WOMEN:
Eliza

ELIZA:
I put myself back in the narrative

WOMEN:
Eliza

I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It’s not enough

COMPANY:
Eliza

ELIZA:
I interview every soldier who fought by your side

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
She tells our story

ELIZA:
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you’re running out of

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

Angelica

While she’s alive—

We tell your story

She is buried in Trinity Church

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Near you

ELIZA:
When I needed her most, she was right on

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more”

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

WASHINGTON:
She tells my story

ELIZA:
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

ELIZA:                                                    COMPANY:
Will they tell our story?                             Will they tell your story?

ELIZA:
Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?                               COMPANY:
Will they tell my story?                              Will they tell your story?

ELIZA:
Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

COMPANY:
Will they tell your story?                             COMPANY:
.                                                             Time…
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

FULL COMPANY:
Who tells your story?
